# Hello, I'm Shawn üëã

## Curiosity-Driven Explorer

After 25+ years in tech, this is where I come to play. While my professional life revolves around solution architecture and data strategy at [Applied Curiosity](https://appliedcuriosity.ai), this space is dedicated to my experiments, explorations, and occasional rabbit holes.

## What drives me?

- **Curiosity:** The foundation of everything I do
- **Locality and Simplicity:** Keeping solutions elegant and close to their problems
- **Focus, Flow, and Joy:** Finding the sweet spot where work becomes play
- **Continuous Improvement:** Always asking "what can be better?"
- **Psychological Safety:** Creating spaces where innovation thrives
- **Customer Focus:** Even in play, keeping the end user in mind

## Current Playground Projects

Here you'll find a collection of experiments ranging from documentation tools to plant monitoring systems:

- üìù **notebook_docs**: Capturing documentation from Jupyter notebooks to GitHub pages
- ‚è±Ô∏è **only_this_moment**: Writings and experiments related to Momentary Apps
- ü§† **refactored_space_cowboy**: Tools for managing tags, policies, and Databricks budgeting
- ü§ñ **simple_mcp_example**: A simple example of using MCP with a local model
- üå± **plant_monitoring_study**: Simulating plant monitoring telemetry
- üåÆ **sanchos_irish_tacos**: "This is sanchos irish tacos until it's not"
